For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.\"/pause 800/speak Ent \"Anyways, little human, there's something you can do for me, as you can move quite quickly compared to me. See, we lost the Entwives and now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives on your farm?\"/pause 500/emote farmer 8/pause 800/speak Ent \"What do they look like? I don't remember, now. It has been quite some time. Why don't you bring me a sample of the wood on your farm?
